  Description: ' The sixth most abundant element in the universe, has been known
    since ancient times. Carbon is most commonly obtained from coal deposits, although
    it usually must be processed into a form suitable for commercial use. Three naturally
    occurring allotropes of carbon are known to exist: amorphous, graphite and diamond.'
